# RSA Encryption Decryption Algorithm 🚀

This repository 📁 contains a Python 🐍 script demonstrating the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) encryption and decryption algorithm. Designed as an educational tool 🎓, it helps users understand the basics of RSA cryptography in a clear and interactive way.

## Features 🌟

- **RSA Encryption/Decryption** 🔐: Showcases how RSA can encrypt and decrypt messages, ensuring confidentiality.
- **Digital Signature** ✍️: Demonstrates the signing and verification of messages, securing authenticity and integrity.
- **Combined Operation** 🛡️: Illustrates a practical application combining both signing and encryption for enhanced security.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation 📥

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruvpuri-goswami/RSA-Encryption-Decryption-Algorithm.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd RSA-Algorithm
```

### Usage 💻

To run the script:

```bash
python rsa.py
```

An interactive menu will guide you through different functionalities. Choose an option and follow the prompts to encrypt, decrypt, sign, or verify messages.

## How It Works 🛠️

- The script starts by generating a public and private key pair.
- Choose from various options to encrypt/decrypt, sign, or perform a combined operation.
- Each choice walks you through the RSA process step-by-step, making it easy to grasp how RSA cryptography works.
